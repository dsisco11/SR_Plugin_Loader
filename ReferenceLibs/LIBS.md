> UnityEngine.dll - Found in <Slime rancher install directory>/SlimeRancher_Data/Managed
> UnityEngine.UI.dll - Found in <Slime rancher install directory>/SlimeRancher_Data/Managed
> Assembly-Csharp.dll - Found in <Slime rancher install directory>/SlimeRancher_Data/Managed *NOTE: Make sure you take this file from a version of the game that* **already has SR PluginLoader installed**
