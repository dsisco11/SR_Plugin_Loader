# FAQ
### "An event I need isn't implemented yet!"
File an issue on this project github page and I'll see what I can do about it.
  
### "My anti-virus thinks the installer is a virus!"  
Good, it's doing it's job, and while my installer isn't really a virus it does change the code in some game files and that might certainly look like a virus to some AV's.  
This issue isn't unique to my mod installer either, it's an issue with a lot of code changing mods because they alter your game files. 

### "I need an alternate download link, my Anti-Virus wont let me use yours!"  
Here is an alternate form of the main download link: <a href="https://raw.github.com/dsisco11/SR_Plugin_Loader/master/Installer.zip">Alt. Link</a>.  
If that link will not work then you can try downloading the entire project source code and all (from <a href="https://github.com/dsisco11/SR_Plugin_Loader/archive/master.zip">here</a>), then opening the project folder and finding the folder named "Installer" and running the installer from there.  
If you cannot use either of those links then your anti-virus will probably block ANY link with a zip file containing an .exe or .dll file among others. There is nothing we can do from our end to fix that and youll need to fix it from your computer itself possibly by disabling your anti-virus while you download the file.
