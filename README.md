# FAQ
### "An event I need isn't implemented yet!"
File an issue on this project github page and I'll see what I can do about it.
  
### "My anti-virus thinks the installer is a virus!"  
Good, it's doing it's job, and while my installer isn't really a virus it does change the code in some game files and that might certainly look like a virus to some AV's.  
This issue isn't unique to my mod installer either, it's an issue with a lot of code changing mods because they alter your game files. 

### "Why can't I see the code for your installer?"  
Because it's my own proprietary creation and I have choosen to protect it.  
If I open sourced it then it would be too easy for certain developers of other games who are very opposed to mods to alter their game in a way that might prevent it from working with that game in the future. Needless to say im very very opposed to being told how I can and cant play my own games and so should you be.
